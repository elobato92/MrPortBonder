An automatic script that bonds two interfaces. Intended to work with passive network taps.

This script was built on and for Fedora Linux. It will ask you the name of two interfaces (enp0s, wlp4s0, etc) and bond them together.
To make this work, a new network script is made, and the two original interfaces get two lines added to their scripts.
I hope you find this helpful!
